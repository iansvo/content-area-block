Adds a block content area to a site editor template and stores the blocks in a specified meta field.

== Description ==

This block allows you to add an additional block content area to a site-editor template and store the block output inside a meta field.

Note: Using this plugin requires you to enable template previews (which will let you visually see the new content area you're adding). This can be enabled on any given post or page, but you can optionally set it on by default using a filter.

== Contributing ==
The plugin source code may be found here: https://github.com/iansvo/content-area-block.
